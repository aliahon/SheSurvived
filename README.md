# 🛡️ She Survived — Web Prototype (React)

**She Survived** is a web-based prototype that simulates the core features of a women’s safety system combining a **smart bracelet** and a **mobile app**. This prototype demonstrates how emergency alerts, location tracking, and audio monitoring could function in a real-world scenario — serving as the **foundation for the full version** involving real hardware and mobile deployment.
